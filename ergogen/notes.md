# Ergogen Files

In this folder you can find several configurations that I iterated on while developing this board. So far the configuration that I ended up following is [this one](./staggered_thumb_spread.yaml). Like mentioned in the plans on the cover of this project, I plan on adding a rotary encoder so that I can have a media controller easily available.

The other files may not be as completed as the one before mentioned due to wanting to spend my time on one design at a time.
