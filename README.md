This is the home of my first keyboard project that I dubbed `Yggdrasil`.

## Plans

You can go to the projects tab to see what my current plans for the first version of this board are.

~~I do plan on making a low profile kailh choc variant, but only after I complete the cherry variant will I start working on a choc one.~~ I ended up using a footprint that has support for both :)

At some point I also would like to add to each version an alternative with a rotary encoder, and will create separate variants for that as well.

After I get more familiar with the process of pcb design and manufacturing I'd like to have a try at having a modular pcb, like the corne, where we can break the extra keys that you don't need.
