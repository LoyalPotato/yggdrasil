This is the home of my first keyboard project that I dubbed `Yggdrasil`.

It's a 36% split keyboard that is tailored to be comfortable to my hand span. You can find the build guide [here](./docs/build.md).

You can view [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2uFzhUAN9s) to see it in action.

Here's what it looks like (minus plates)

And with 3d printed plates (and custom cables also done by me hehe :) )

Full wrap around case, also 3d printed

## Design Article

If you're interested in knowing more about the design process that I went through and the final cost for me (in Portugal), I wrote a [post](https://loyalpotato.com/projects/yggdrasil) about it :)

## Plans

You can go to the projects tab to see what my current plans for the first version of this board are.

~~I do plan on making a low profile kailh choc variant, but only after I complete the cherry variant will I start working on a choc one.~~ I ended up using a footprint that has support for both :)

At some point I also would like to add to each version an alternative with a rotary encoder, and will create separate variants for that as well.

After I get more familiar with the process of pcb design and manufacturing I'd like to have a try at having a modular pcb, like the corne, where we can break the extra keys that you don't need.
